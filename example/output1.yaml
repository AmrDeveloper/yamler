# <- yaml supports comments, json does not
# did you know you can embed json in yaml?
# try uncommenting the next line
# { foo: 'bar' }

json:
  - rigid
  - better for data interchange
yaml:
  - slim and flexible
  - better for configuration
object:
 key: helloworld
  array:
    - boolean: true
    - integer: 1
